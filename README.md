## Salary Survey data cleaned and visualized for Software Engineers in US
#### This project was done to practice exploratory data analysis and data cleaning practices.


The dataset consists of answers to survey questions about salaries of various jobs in different industries from around the world.
Most survey answers are from the US and hence, USA was selected for analysis. 
The objective of this analysis was to explore if female and non-binary software engineers received lower salaries in contrast to male software engineers.

## Conclusion 

The charts show that the median salary for female and non-binary software engineers was lower than male software engineers. 
However, the dataset did include a lot of inconsistent data. The number of male software engineers was considerably higher than their female and non-binary counterparts.
In addition, lots of survey participants refused to disclose their gender, marking it as Prefer Not To Answer.
